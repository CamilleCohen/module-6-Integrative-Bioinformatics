### Session 1: Functional interpretation of gene sets

Teachers: Jacques van Helden and Olivier Sand

[Pr√©sentation](Session1/DU-Bii_2019_m6s1_Integrative-bioinformatics-intro.pdf)

Concepts:

- functional annotations,
- Gene Ontology,
- pathways (metabolic, signaling),
- biomolecular networks (protein-protein, co-expression, molecular complexes, metabolic reactions)

Resources:

- databases containing these data types.
- g:Profiler (Web site + R library)
- metabolic mapping tools (KEGG pathway coloring).

Enrichment tests:
- goals,
- principles and approaches: enrichment, GSEA, ...
- statistics (seen in the course Stat with R),
- good practices (choice of an appropriate background, multiple testing correction),
- interpretation of the results)

Application:
- Annotation of groups of genes produced by the other courses (e.g. differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq, disease-associated genes, ...)
